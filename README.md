Project Definition: Bhagvat Geeta Mobile App (Departure)

Project Description:
"Departure" is a mobile application aimed at providing a comprehensive and user-friendly
platform for studying and exploring the teachings of Bhagvat Geeta. Built using Flutter, the app
incorporates various concepts such as local JSON bank and Shared Preferences to enhance the
user experience. It offers a range of functionalities designed to facilitate easy navigation,
customization, and accessibility for users.
The "Departure" app aims to create an immersive and personalized experience for users seeking
spiritual guidance through the teachings of the Bhagvat Geeta. By incorporating local JSON
storage, Shared Preferences, like functionality, themes, chapter images, splash screens, detailed
verse screens, and multi-language support, the app offers a comprehensive solution for users to
explore and engage with this sacred text.

Project Objectives:
Local JSON Bank: The app leverages local JSON storage to efficiently store and retrieve
Bhagvat Geeta verses. This approach ensures quick access to the verses, even in offline mode,
enabling seamless reading and study of the sacred text.
Like Bhagvad Geeta's Verse: Users can like or bookmark specific verses, allowing them to
create a personalized collection of their favorite teachings. The app utilizes local storage to save
these preferences and provides a dedicated page to display the liked verses for quick reference.
Light & Dark Themes: "Departure" offers a visually appealing experience with customizable
themes. Users can switch between light and dark themes based on their preferences, ensuring
comfortable reading in different lighting conditions.
Images in Each Verse's Chapters: To enhance the understanding and visual appeal of the
verses, the app includes relevant images or illustrations for each chapter of the Bhagvat Geeta.
These images are displayed alongside the corresponding verses, providing a holistic learning
experience.

Splash Screen: The app features a captivating splash screen that engages users and sets the tone
for their spiritual journey. The splash screen can showcase the app logo, a meaningful image, or
a motivational quote, welcoming users to the world of Bhagvat Geeta.
Detail Screen for Each Verse: Every verse in the Bhagvat Geeta is given special attention with
a dedicated detail screen. Users can access in-depth explanations, commentaries, and
interpretations of each verse, allowing for a deeper understanding and reflection on the
teachings.

Multi-language Support: Recognizing the diversity of languages in which the Bhagvat Geeta
